# MIMLDGC
This is the Matlab implementation of the MIMLDGC algorithm for multi-instance multi-label learning:

Zafra, A., & Gibaja, E. (2023). Nearest neighbor-based approaches for multi-instance multi-label classification. Expert Systems with Applications, 120876. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.120876

The Java implementation of the algorithm is available in the MIML library.

As the algoritm computes distances to determine the neighbourhood, the data should be normalized to [0, 1] before run.
